A novel is a long-form fictional narrative prose story that typically explores the experiences, emotions, and actions of characters over an extended period. Novels are a popular and versatile literary form, encompassing a wide range of genres and styles. They can be realistic or fantastical, historical or contemporary, and may focus on various themes such as love, adventure, mystery, or social issues.

Novels typically have a complex structure, with multiple characters, a developed plot, and often include subplots. The length of a novel can vary, but it is generally longer than a short story or novella. Novels provide authors with the opportunity to delve deeply into characters' thoughts and motivations, as well as to explore intricate storylines.

Some well-known examples of novels include "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen, "1984" by George Orwell, "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee, and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" by J.K. Rowling.
